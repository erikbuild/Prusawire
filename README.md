# Prusawire 2025.B1

![Render](Assets/render.png)

A wholly unofficial Prusa MK3 and MK4 total conversion mod, from Positron's April Fools of 2025.


## About

Nomad of Positron3D came up with this idea shortly after completing their Switchwire build. The idea started as a quick design exercise, to try and convert a Prusa MK4S frame into a Switchwire, using everything left over from a CORE One Upgrade.

As the first iteration wrapped up, I took interest in the project, and decided to take this April Fools joke one step further and build it into a reliable machine.

After months of hard work, please enjoy the build ❤

## Who This Printer is For

Pick one of the following:

 - You have an old MK3, MK3S, or MK3S+, and you want to teach an old dog new tricks and are on a budget
 - You upgraded from MK4S to a Core ONE, and have a leftover frame. You are okay spending money on building a new printer with that hardware.

Additionally, the following says this printer is for you: 

 - You want to take your first steps into RepRap beyond Prusa, and Voron is an exciting route.
 - You are comfortable working from a CAD file as your build guide
 - You respect the Frankenstein-y nature of this April Fools joke printer

## Want to Support the Project?

First of all, thank you! Development costs have been mostly self-funded, with filament sponsored by Levendigs, and LDO Motors for providing the funds for the Prusa MK4 frame.
